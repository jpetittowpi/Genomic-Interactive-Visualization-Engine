### Overview

`<bed-track-dom>` is the Web Component to display BED tracks. It's part of
`GIVe.BedTrack` object and is used to visualize data from the `GIVe.BedTrack`
object.

Please refer to [`GIVe.TrackObject`](../index.html) for details on tracks in
general, to [`GIVe.BedTrack`](./bed-track/index.html) for details on BED
track implementation, or to [Polymer element registration](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/registering-elements)
for Polymer Element guide, including lifecycles, properties, methods and others.
